# v1.2.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.2.0 improve search relevancy and performance but also introduces new filter operators like `IS NULL` and `IS EMPTY`!

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs, and the link should be added as soon as possible during the pre-release -->
üìñ Meilisearch's official documentation will be ready for the official v1.2.0 release. Meanwhile, work-in-progress documentation is available [here]().

# New features and improvements üî•

## Delete documents using filtering

TBD

Done by @dureuill and @irevoire in #3550.

## New filter operators: `IS EMPTY` and `IS NULL`

During the search, you can use [filtering](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/search#filter) and retrieve documents containing `null` or empty fields.

For example with the following set of documents:

```json
[{
    "id": 0,
    "color": []
},
{
    "id": 1,
    "color": null
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "color": ""
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "color": {}
},
{
    "id": 4
}]
```

The filter `color IS EMPTY` selects the document ids `0`, `2` and `3` while the filter `color IS NOT EMPTY` or `NOT color IS EMPTY` selects the document ids `1` and `4`.

The filter `color IS NULL` selects the document ids `1` while the filter `color IS NOT NULL` or `NOT color IS NULL` selects the document ids `0`, `2`, `3` and `4`.

Done by @Kerollmops in #3571.
