# v1.5.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.5 introduces improvements in indexing speed and the possibility of triggering snapshots on-demand, as it's already possible with dumps.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Indexing speed improvements

For datasets containing a lot of words (and/or with a large variety of words), we improved the indexing speed between 5% and 20%, depending on your use cases and your documents. The more your documents contain a lot of words, the more the improvements will be visible.

The relevancy can be slightly different for queries containing 4 words or more. Let us know [here](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions) if you have any issues or unexpected behavior.

For datasets containing only a few words per field, even if you have a huge number of fields, the improvement might not be visible. Don't worry, we keep working on the indexing speed in the next sprint to address other use cases.

Done by @ManyThiFish in #4131

Diff indexing??? -> TBD if present in the sprint.

## Snapshots on-demand

We have introduced a new route, similar to the `/dumps` one, creating snapshots on-demand.

To create a snapshot:

```bash
curl -X POST HTTP://localhost:7700/snapshots
```

This route will return a [task](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/tasks).

The snapshot file will be created on your machine in the directory defined with [`--snapshot-dir` flag](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/instance_options#snapshot-destination) (default: `snapshots/`)

Done by @irevoire in #4051.

## Experimental feature: export Puffin Reports

Enabling this experimental feature will make Meilisearch automatically export `.puffin` file reports. Analyzing those files can give great information on what's happening inside the engine and how the Meilisearch team can improve the indexing performances.

How to activate the feature:

```bash
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
--data-binary '{
    "exportPuffinReports": true
  }'
```

üì£ To get more information about the feature or to give any feedback, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/693).

Done by @Kerollmops in #4073.

## Other improvements

* Make the [experimental `/metrics` route](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/625) activable via HTTP, and not only via CLI flag. Done by @braddotcoffee with the review of @vivek-26 in #4126.
‚ö†Ô∏è We don't recommend using CLI flag and HTTP calls at the same time to manage this feature.
