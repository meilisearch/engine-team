# v1.5.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.5 introduces improvements in indexing speed and the possibility of triggering snapshots on demand.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Indexing speed improvements

For datasets containing a lot of words (and/or with a large variety of words), we improved the indexing speed between 5% and 20%, depending on your use cases and your documents. The more your documents contain a lot of words, the more the improvements will be visible.

The relevancy can be slightly different for queries containing 4 words or more. Let us know [here](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions) if you have any issues or unexpected behavior.

For datasets containing only a few words per field, even if you have a huge number of fields, the improvement might not be visible. Don't worry, we keep working on the indexing speed in the next sprint to address other use cases.

## Snapshots on-demand

This release introduces a new `/snapshots` API route for creating snapshots on demand:

```bash
curl -X POST HTTP://localhost:7700/snapshots
```

This route returns a [summarized task object](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/tasks).

By default, Meilisearch creates snapshots inside the `/snapshots` directory. You can customize this directory with the [`--snapshot-dir` configuration option](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/instance_options#snapshot-destination). 

Done by @irevoire in #4051.

## Experimental feature: Export Puffin reports

This experimental feature allows Meilisearch to automatically export `.puffin`  reports. `.puffin` files provide information on Meilisearch's internal processes and may be useful when diagnosing performance issues.

Use the `/experimental-features` endpoint to activate this feature:
```bash
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "exportPuffinReports": true
  }'
```
