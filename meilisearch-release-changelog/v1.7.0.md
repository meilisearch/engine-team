# v1.7.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.7.0 mostly focuses on improving v1.6.0 features, indexing speed and hybrid search. GPU computing is now supported.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Add GPU support to compute embeddings (experimental feature)

Enabling the CUDA feature allows using an available GPU to compute embeddings with a `huggingFace` embedder.
On an AWS Graviton 2, this yields a x3 - x5 improvement on indexing time.

üëá How to enable GPU support through CUDA for HuggingFace embedding generation:

**Prerequisites**

- Linux distribution with a compatible CUDA version
- NVidia GPU with CUDA support
- A recent Rust compiler to compile Meilisearch from source

**Steps**

1. Follow [the guide](https://huggingface.github.io/candle/guide/installation.html) to install the CUDA dependencies
2. Clone Meilisearch: `git clone https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch.git`
3. Compile Meilisearch with the `cuda` feature: `cargo build --release --features cuda`
4. In the freshly compiled Meilisearch, enable the vector store experimental feature:
```bash
‚ùØ curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
--data-binary '{ "vectorStore": true }'
```
5. Add an HuggingFace embedder to the settings:
```bash
curl \
-X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/your_index/settings/embedders' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary \
'{ "default": { "source": "huggingFace" } }'
```
