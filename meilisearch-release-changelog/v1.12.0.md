# v1.12.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
> [!WARNING]
> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.12 introduces huge improvements regarding indexing speed. The team worked hard to divise time to import huge datasets by two. You can also customize your settings to adapt your indexing needs and so, the indexing speed that fits your usage.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## Improve indexing speed

Indexing time for huge dataset import (multiple millions of documents) is divided by two!

TBD: give more data and metrics about improvements

Done by @dureuill, @ManyTheFish, and @Kerollmops in #4900.

## TBD: Customize settings to improve indexing speed

TBD

## More visibility around indexing tasks

In order to give more visibility around indexing processing around your `task`, especially when indexing big documents, new routes have been introduced:
- `GET /batches/:uid`: returns a specific `batch` object
- `GET /batches`: return a list of `batch` objects

The same query parameters than `GET /tasks` route can be used to apply filtering.

TBD: an example of batch object

Also, a new field is introduced in the task object: `batch`.

TBD: an example of the new `task` object, one `progress` in implemented.

Done by @irevoire in #5060, #5070, #5080

## Other improvements

* Introduce the `reverse` query parameter for `GET‚ÄØ/tasks` route set to `false` by default. If set to `true`, then the tasks will be returned in reversed order (the oldest first). Done by @irevoire in #5048.
* Make matches consider phrases as a single `Match` by @flevi29 in #4928
* Adds new metrics to prometheus by @PedroTurik in #5044
* Add `indices` field to `_matchesPosition` to specify where in an array a match comes from, by @LukasKalbertodt in #5005
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking for users of the experimental `vectorStore` feature: The field distribution no longer contains `_vectors`. Its value used to be incorrect, and fixing it gives it a very uninteresting value, as all documents in an index with an embedder have a (potentially empty) `_vectors` field. Done as part of #4900

# Fixes üêû

* Return an appropriate error when primary keys is greater than 512 bytes, by @flevi29 in #4930

# Misc

* Dependencies updates
  * Update benchmarks to match the new crates subfolder by @Kerollmops in #5021
  * Fix the benchmarks by @irevoire in #5037

  * Improve performance of `formatted.rs` by @PedroTurik in #5043
  * Fix the path used in the flaky tests CI by @Kerollmops in #5049
* Misc
