# v0.30.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

This release removes index deployment downtime and adds new task management features. It also introduces new search parameters that facilitate the creation of numbered pagination interfaces.

Thanks to Hacktoberfest, tons of updates and bug fixes have been done by the fantastic Meilisearch community. You were more present than ever and words cannot make justice tojust  how grateful we are for your support. A big thank you from the whole Meilisearch team! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
üìñ Meilisearch's official documentation will be ready for the official v0.30.0 release. Meanwhile, work-in-progress documentation is available [here]().

# New features and improvements üî•

## Cancel processing and enqueued tasks

When you need need to perform indexing operations on Meilisearch, you can end up with a long task being processed you finally want to stop: Meilisearch can now cancel `enqueued` or `processing` tasks.

When using the `POST /tasks/cancel`, you have to use one of the following query parameters to filter: `uid`, `status`, `type`, `indexUid`, or a date (using `afterXAt` and `beforeXAt` where `X` is `enqueued`, `started` or `finished`)

For example, to cancel tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/cancel?uid=1,2'
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "movies",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "taskCancelation",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

To cancel all your tasks:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/cancel?status=processing,enqueued'
```

## Delete old processed tasks

To reduce the occupied space on your disk, you can remove the finished tasks (`succeeded`, `failed` or `canceled`) kept in the Meilisearch history.

When using the `DELETE /tasks`, you have to use one of the following query parameters to filter: `uid`, `status`, `type`, `indexUid`, or a date (using `afterXAt` and `beforeXAt` where `X` is `enqueued`, `started` or `finished`).

For example, to delete tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/tasks?uid=1,2'
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 3,
  "indexUid": null,
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "taskDeletion",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

To delete all your tasks:

```bash
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/tasks?status=failed,succeeded,canceled'
```

## Remove downtime: swap indexes

When doing important changes on a primary data store, you need them to be synchronized with Meilisearch. To avoid any downtime, Meilisearch now provides a seamless way to point to a new up-to-date index: swapping indexes.

To swap indexes, use:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/swap-indexes'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '
    [
      { "indexes": ["indexA", "indexB"] }
    ]
  '
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 3,
  "indexUid": null,
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "indexSwap",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

## Configuration file support

You can now pass a configuration file to Meilisearch to set [the available options](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/configuration/instance_options.html#all-instance-options).

By default, Meilisearch will read the file present in the working directory named: `./config.toml`.

To pass another configuration file, you can use the `--config-file-path` option:

```bash
meilisearch --config-file-path="./my-config.toml"
```

Example of configuration file:

```toml
env = "production"
master_key = "MY_MASTER_KEY"
schedule_snapshot = true
```

You can also download the default configuration file we provide in our repository:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/main/config.toml > config.toml
```
