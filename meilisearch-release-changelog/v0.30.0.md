# v0.30.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

This release introduces index deployment with zero downtime and adds task management features. It also brings the capability to navigate search results by page selection.

Thanks to Hacktoberfest, tons of updates and bug fixes have been done by the fantastic Meilisearch community. You were more present than ever, and words cannot do justice to just how grateful we are for your support. A big thank you from the whole Meilisearch team! ‚ù§Ô∏è

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ Most integrations (SDKs, clients, libraries) will be compatible with this version within four hours of the release. Sometimes this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the issues we encounter during the release.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
Here is the exhaustive list of integrations  **not immediately compatible** with v0.30.0:
- [meilisearch-dart](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-dart) and [meilisearch-swift](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift): though you can use still use both libraries with v0.30.0, the new available features are not yet available. Let us know if you really need it‚Äîand contributions are always welcome!
- [meilisearch-java](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-java): Our team is still working on refactoring the code; this is reaching the end, but the SDK cannot be used with v0.30.0 yet. Follow the repository to know when it will be compatible.

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
üìñ Meilisearch's official documentation will be ready for the official v0.30.0 release. Meanwhile, work-in-progress documentation is available [here]().

# New features and improvements üî•

## Improve search result navigation: exhaustive number of search results

When paginating search results with `offset` and `limit`, Meilisearch only returns an estimate of the total number of results. Since `estimatedTotalHits` can change, creating reliable pagination interfaces with numbered page selectors is challenging.

v0.30 introduces two new search parameters, `page` and `hitsPerPage`. Queries with these parameters return an exhaustive number of `totalHits` and `totalPages`, which you can then use to create UI elements such as numbered page selectors.

The following example fetches the second page of results for a given query:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "shifu", "page": "2", "hitsPerPage": "10" }'
```

```json
{
    "hits": [
        // ‚Ä¶ 10 hits
    ],
    // ‚Ä¶
    "page": 2,
    "hitsPerPage": 10,
    "totalHits": 2100,
    "totalPages": 210
}
```

## Cancel processing and enqueued tasks

Meilisearch now allows you to cancel `enqueued` or `processing` tasks through a new API route, `/tasks/cancel`. This can be useful when you need to interrupt a task that is taking too much time to be completed or enqueued by mistake.

To cancel tasks, filter them by specifying one of the following query parameters: `uids`, `statuses`, `types`, or `indexUids`.

Tasks can be filtered by date fields:
- `beforeEnqueuedAt` / `afterEnqueuedAt`
- `beforeStartedAt` / `afterStartedAt`

For example, to cancel tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/cancel?uids=1,2'
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "null",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "taskCancelation",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

To cancel all enqueued tasks across all indexes in an instance:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/cancel?statuses=enqueued'
```

## Delete the task history

This release introduces a new `DELETE` endpoint to the `/tasks` route. You can use it to remove finished tasks (`succeeded`, `failed` or `canceled`) from Meilisearch's task history. This can be helpful in reducing the amount of occupied disk space.

To delete finished tasks, filter them by specifying one of the following query parameters: `uids`, `statuses`, `types`, `indexUids`, or `canceledBy`.

Tasks can be filtered by date fields:
- `beforeEnqueuedAt` / `afterEnqueuedAt`
- `beforeStartedAt` / `afterStartedAt`
- `beforeFinishedAt` / `afterFinishedAt`

For example, to delete tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/tasks?uids=1,2'
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 3,
  "indexUid": null,
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "taskDeletion",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

To delete all finished tasks in an instance:

```bash
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/tasks?statuses=failed,succeeded,canceled'
```

## Deploy indexes with zero downtime

Deploy new indexes version with zero downtime to the search clients. Meilisearch now provides a seamless way to deploy multiple indexes atomically with the new swap indexes API.

To swap indexes, use the new `/swap-indexes` route:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/swap-indexes'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '[
      { "indexes": ["indexA", "indexB"] }
  ]'
```

```json
{
  "taskUid": 3,
  "indexUid": null,
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "indexSwap",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-12T10:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

Done in #2763 by @irevoire, @Kerollmops, and @loiclec.

## Configuration file support

You can now use a configuration file to set [instance options](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/configuration/instance_options.html#all-instance-options).

By default, Meilisearch will search the working directory for a file named `./config.toml`.

You can use the `--config-file-path` option if you want to keep your configuration file in another directory:

```bash
meilisearch --config-file-path="./my-config.toml"
```

Example of configuration file:

```toml
env = "production"
master_key = "MY_MASTER_KEY"
schedule_snapshot = true
```

You can download a default configuration file from our repository:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/main/config.toml > config.toml
```
