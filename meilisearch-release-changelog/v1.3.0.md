# v1.3.0 release changelogs

Meilisearch v1.3.0 introduces Meilisearch as a vector store, it introduces visible ranking score details and defining a field to search on at search time.  It also now includes the ability to search within facet values and facet values that are sortable.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Vector Store - Experimental
The release of v1.3.0 enables Meilisearch to serve as a vector store. This means Meilisearch now accepts vectors in documents, stores them, and lets users retrieve the nearest documents using the search endpoint.

This experimental feature can be enabled at runtime using v1.3.0's new `/experimental-features` endpoint.
```bash
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
--data-binary '{
    "vectorSearch": true
  }'

```

### Sending Vectorized Documents

For the first iteration of this feature you must compute the vectors on your side before sending to Meilisearch. Vectors should be sent with the document itself using the `_vectors` field. Multiple vectors can be sent for a single document.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note the size of the vectors must be the same across all of your documents. If the sizes are inconsistent you will see an error in your tasks.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/myvectors/documents' \
--data-binary '[
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "text": "Hello World" },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "text": "Hello Doggy" },
    { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "text": "Hello People" }
]'
```

### Query Meilisearch using Vectors

You can query the nearest documents using the default `/search` route by sending the vector of your query via the `vector` field. Again, for the first iteration you must compute the vector query on your side before requesting from Meilisearch.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/myvectors/search' \
--data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

### Similarity score
As part of v1.3.0 Meilisearch will return a similarity score as part of the documents retrieved. This score will be between 0 and 1 and viewed under the `_semanticSimilarity` property. The higher the ranking score, the more similar the document.

```json
{
  "hits": [
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "text": "Hello World", "_semanticSimilarity": 0.6754 },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "text": "Hello Doggy", "_semanticSimilarity": 0.7546 },
    { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "text": "Hello People", "_semanticSimilarity": 0.78 }
  ],
  "query": "",
  "vector": [0, 1, 2],
  "processingTimeMs": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "estimatedTotalHits": 2
}
```


üó£Ô∏è Since this feature is experimental, we need your help to iterate on it! You are more than welcome to share your thoughts and your feedback on [this discussion](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/677).

‚ö†Ô∏è The experimental feature API can break between Meilisearch versions. Be careful if using it in production.

## Display ranking scores at search

Meilisearch v1.3.0 introduces ranking scores per document via the `showRankingScore` search query parameter. With this in place each document will return with a `_rankingScore` property displaying a score between 0 and 1. The higher the ranking score, the more relevant the document.

```json 
"_rankingScore": 0.8575757575757575,
```

### Ranking score details - Experimental 

Additionally, as an experimental feature, you can view detailed scores per ranking rule for each document via the `showRankingScoreDetails` search query parameter. With this in place each document will return with an `_rankingScoreDetails` JSON object. That object will contain a property and a score value for each ranking rule. 

```json 
"_rankingScoreDetails": {
                "words": {
                    "order": 0,
                    "matchingWords": 1,
                    "maxMatchingWords": 1,
                    "score": 1.0
                },
                "typo": {
                    "order": 1,
                    "typoCount": 0,
                    "maxTypoCount": 1,
                    "score": 1.0
                },
                "proximity": {
                    "order": 2,
                    "score": 1.0
                },
                "attribute": {
                    "order": 3,
                    "attributes_ranking_order": 0.8,
                    "attributes_query_word_order": 0.6363636363636364,
                    "score": 0.7272727272727273
                },
                "exactness": {
                    "order": 4,
                    "matchType": "noExactMatch",
                    "score": 0.3333333333333333
                }
            }
```

This experimental feature can be turned on at runtime using v1.3.0's new `/experimental-features` endpoint.
```bash
 curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
--data-binary '{
    "scoreDetails": true
  }'

```

## Define field to search on at search time

v1.3.0 introduces a new search parameter, `attributesToSearchOn`.

`attributesToSearchOn` is a search parameter accepting an array of strings indicating one or more document attributes. Queries using `attributesToSearchOn` will restrict the search to the indicated attributes.

Given the following dataset:
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Our Wives Under the Sea",
  "genre": ["horror", "scifi"],
  "synopsis": "A woman returns to her wife transformed after a deep-sea adventure."
},
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "A Strange and Stubborn Endurance",
  "genre": ["adventure"],
  "synopsis": "A man must overcome trauma and fight off a mysterious assassin."
}
```
And the following query:
```json
{
  "q": "adventure",
  "attributesToSearchOn": ["genre"]
}
```
Meilisearch will only return document 1.

Both documents contain the word adventure, but `"attributesToSearchOn": ["genre"]` instructs Meilisearch to only consider results found on the genre field.

## Search for facet values
Meilisearch v1.3.0 introduces a new endpoint  `POST /indexes/{index}/facet-search` that allows you to search for facet values. Only fields defined as `filterableAttributes` will be facet-searchable. Facet search supports [prefix search](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/advanced/prefix) and [typo tolerance](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/typo_tolerance).

Done by @Kerollmops in (#3611)

## Sort facet values by count
By default, all facet values are sorted in ascending alphanumeric order. With the release of v1.3.0 you can change this using the `sortFacetValuesBy` property of the [`faceting` index settings](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/settings#faceting). This will allow you to sort facet by value count i.e. the genre with the highest number of results shows first.
