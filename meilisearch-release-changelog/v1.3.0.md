# v1.3.0 release changelogs

Meilisearch v1.3.0 introduces vector search, visible ranking score details, and the possibility to define fields to search on at search time. It also now includes the ability to search within facet values and sort facet values by count.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Vector Search ‚Äî Experimental

You can now use Meilisearch as a vector store. Meilisearch allows you to add vector embeddings generated by third-party software, and use embeddings when searching with the `/search` or `/multi-search` routes.

This experimental feature can be enabled via the HTTP API using v1.3.0's new `/experimental-features` endpoint.

```bash
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

### Sending Vectorized Documents

For the first iteration of this feature you must compute the vectors separately. Once that is done, include them in your documents using the `_vectors` field. Finally, send the documents with vector data to your instance. A single document may contain multiple vectors.

‚ö†Ô∏è Vector size must be the same across all documents in a dataset. If vector sizes are inconsistent, Meilisearch will return an error during document addition.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/songs/documents' \
  --data-binary '[
      { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "title": "Across The Universe" },
      { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "title": "All Things Must Pass" },
      { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "title": "And Your Bird Can Sing" }
  ]'
```

### Query Meilisearch using Vectors

Use the new `vector` search parameter with the `/search` and `/multi-search` to search for documents with the nearest vector. You must compute the vector query with a third-party tool.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/songs/search' \
--data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

### Similarity score

When you use vector search, returned documents include a `_semanticScore` field.

```json
{
  "hits": [
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "title": "Across The Universe", "_semanticScore": 0.6754 },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "title": "All Things Must Pass", "_semanticScore": 0.7546 },
    { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "title": "And Your Bird Can Sing", "_semanticScore": 0.78 }
  ],
  "query": "",
  "vector": [0, 1, 2],
  "processingTimeMs": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "estimatedTotalHits": 2
}
```

## Display ranking scores at search

Use the new `showRankingScore` search parameter to see the ranking scores for returned documents. 

```bash 
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "Batman Returns", "showRankingScore": true }'
```

Each returned document will include a `_rankingScore` property displaying a score between 0 and 1. The higher the ranking score, the more relevant the document.

```json 
"_rankingScore": 0.8575757575757575,
```

### Ranking score details ‚Äî Experimental 

View detailed scores per ranking rule for each document with the experimental `showRankingScoreDetails` search parameter. 

```bash 
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "Batman Returns", "showRankingScoreDetails": true }'
```

When `showRankingScoreDetails` is set to `true`, returned documents include a `_rankingScoreDetails` field. This field contains score values for each ranking rule.

```json 
"_rankingScoreDetails": {
  "words": {
    "order": 0,
    "matchingWords": 1,
    "maxMatchingWords": 1,
    "score": 1.0
  },
  "typo": {
    "order": 1,
    "typoCount": 0,
    "maxTypoCount": 1,
    "score": 1.0
  },
  "proximity": {
    "order": 2,
    "score": 1.0
  },
  "attribute": {
    "order": 3,
    "attributes_ranking_order": 0.8,
    "attributes_query_word_order": 0.6363636363636364,
    "score": 0.7272727272727273
  },
  "exactness": {
    "order": 4,
    "matchType": "noExactMatch",
    "score": 0.3333333333333333
  }
}
```

This experimental feature can be turned on via the HTTP API using v1.3.0's new `/experimental-features` endpoint. 

```bash
 curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "scoreDetails": true
  }'
```

### Relevancy change on `attribute` ranking rule

The `attribute` ranking rule now determines relevancy based on the distance to the position of the word in the query rather than the absolute distance to the beginning of a document.

Previously, documents with attributes containing search terms at the beginning of the attribute would be considered more relevant than documents containing search terms at the end of an attribute.

Done by @dureuill in #3771

## Define fields to search on at search time

`attributesToSearchOn` is a new search parameter accepting an array of strings indicating one or more document attributes. Queries using `attributesToSearchOn` will restrict the search to the indicated attributes. 

Attributes passed to `attributesToSearchOn` must be in the [searchable attributes list](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/displayed_searchable_attributes#the-searchableattributes-list).

Given the following dataset:


```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Our Wives Under the Sea",
  "genre": ["horror", "scifi"],
  "synopsis": "A woman returns to her wife transformed after a deep-sea adventure."
},
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "A Strange and Stubborn Endurance",
  "genre": ["adventure"],
  "synopsis": "A man must overcome trauma and fight off a mysterious assassin."
}
```


And the following query:


```json
{
  "q": "adventure",
  "attributesToSearchOn": ["genre"]
}
```
Meilisearch will only return document 1.

Both documents contain the term `"adventure"`, but `"attributesToSearchOn": ["genre"]` instructs Meilisearch to only consider results found on the `genre` field.

## Search for facet values
The new endpoint `POST /indexes/{index}/facet-search` allows you to search for facet values. Only fields defined as `filterableAttributes` will be facet-searchable.

Facet search supports [prefix search](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/advanced/prefix) and [typo tolerance](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/configuration/typo_tolerance).

```bash
 curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/facet-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "facetName": "genres",
    "facetQuery": "a"
  }'
```

Done by @Kerollmops in (#3699)

## Sort facet values by count


Order facets by `count` using the `sortFacetValuesBy` property of the [`faceting` index settings](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/settings#faceting). This allows you to sort facet values in descending order by the number of matched documents containing that facet value.

It is possible to change this ordering for all facets using `*`:

```bash
 curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/faceting \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "sortFacetValuesBy": {"*": "count"}
  }'
```

Alternatively, it is possible to order a single facet by `count`, while other attributes follow alphanumeric ordering:

```bash
 curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/faceting \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
--data-binary '{
    "sortFacetValuesBy": {"*": "alpha", "genre": 'count'}
  }'
```

## Language support improvements

* Enhance Japanese word segmentation (#218) @mosuka
* Enhance separator-based Tokenization (#215) @ManyTheFish
  - words containing `_` are now properly segmented into several words
  - brackets `{([])}` are no longer considered as context separators for the `proximity` ranking rule

Done by @ManyTheFish, @mosuka in [#3866] and in [Charabia v0.8.1](https://github.com/meilisearch/charabia/releases/tag/v0.8.1)
