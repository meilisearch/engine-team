# v1.14.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
> [!WARNING]
> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports[#new]]((https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new)/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.14 gives more granular control over which parts of filters you can disable for indexing performance optimization. This release also includes composite embedders, which can improve embedding generation during search and indexing, and a new route to retrieve multiple documents by their IDs.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## Granular filterable attribute settings

v1.14 gives you more control over which types of filter you want to disable in your searches. This allows you to further optimize indexing speeds by letting you activate only the filter features you need.

Use `PATCH /indexes/INDEX_NAME/settings` to specify which filters you want to enable for each attribute in your documents:

```json
{
	"filterableAttributes": [
	  {
	    "attributePatterns": ["genre", "artist"],
	    "features": {
	      "facetSearch": true,
	      "filter": {
	        "equality": true,
	        "comparison": false
	      }
	    }
	  },
	  {
	    "attributePatterns": ["rank"],
	    "features": {
	      "facetSearch": false,
	      "filter": {
	        "equality": true,
	        "comparison": true
	      }
	    }
	  }
	]
}
```

## Composite embedders

This feature allows using different embedders at search and indexing time. This can be useful when optimizing AI-powered search performance. For example, you may prefer to use:
- A remote embedder during indexing, as remote embedders have higher bandwidth and can generate more embeddings per second
- A local embedder when answering to search queries, as local embedders have lower latency and can respond more quickly to user input

To use the feature, follow these steps:

1. Enable the `Composite embedders` feature with the Meilisearch Cloud interface, or with the `/experimental-features` route:

```sh
curl MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  -d '{"compositeEmbedders": true}'
```
2. Next, create an embedder, setting its `source` to `"composite"` and defining one `searchEmbedder` and one `indexingEmbedder`:
```jsonc
{
  "embedders": {
    "text": {
      "source": "composite",
      "searchEmbedder": {
        "source": "huggingFace",
        "model": "baai/bge-base-en-v1.5",
        "revision": "a5beb1e3e68b9ab74eb54cfd186867f64f240e1a"
      },
      "indexingEmbedder": {
        "source": "rest",
        "url": "https://URL.endpoints.huggingface.cloud",
        "apiKey": "hf_XXXXXXX",
        "documentTemplate": "Your {{doc.template}}",
        "request": {
          "inputs": [
            "{{text}}",
            "{{..}}"
          ]
        },
        "response": [
          "{{embedding}}",
          "{{..}}"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
3. Once the composite embedder has been created, Meilisearch will use its `indexingEmbedder` during indexing and `searchEmbedder` when responding to user queries

For more details about this feature, please refer to its [public usage page](https://www.notion.so/meilisearch/Composite-embedder-usage-14a4b06b651f81859dc3df21e8cd02a0?pvs=4#19f4b06b651f809ab3ecc0daae7d5856).

## Retrieve multiple documents by ID

It is now possible to retrieve multiple documents by their IDs:

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' MEILISEARCH_URL/indexes/INDEX_UID/documents -d '{ "ids": ["cody", "finn", "brandy", "gambit"] }'
```

```jsonc
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "brandy",
      "info": 13765493
    },
    {
      "id": "finn",
      "info": 35863
    },
    {
      "id": "cody",
      "info": 122263
    },
    {
      "id": "gambit",
      "info": 22222
    }
  ],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "total": 4
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Documents are *not* returned in the queried order. Non-existent documents are ignored.
