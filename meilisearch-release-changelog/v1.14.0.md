Meilisearch v1.14 exposes a more granular way to express your filterable attributes! üéâ This release also improves the performances of semantic search, the indexing speed of embeddings and a new route to get multiple documents by IDs.

üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.
