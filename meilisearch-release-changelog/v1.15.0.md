We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.15 adds a new typo tolerance setting, allowing you to disable typo tolerance for numbers. It also enables comparison operators for string filters.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## Disable typo tolerance for numbers

Set `typoTolerance.disableOnNumbers` to `true` to disable typo tolerance for numbers:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "typoTolerance": {"disableOnNumbers": true}
  }'
```

Deactivating the typo tolerance on numbers can be useful when trying to reduce false positives, such as a query term `2024` returning results that include `2025` and `2004`. It may also improve indexing performance.

Done by @ManyTheFish in [#5494](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5494).

## Lexicographic string filters

This release allows you to filter strings lexicographically by enabling comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, TO) on string values:
```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "filter": "release_date >= '2024-06'"
  }'
```

This new feature can be particularly useful when filtering human-readable dates.
