## Deactivate Typo Tolerance on Numbers

TBD

Done by @ManyTheFish in [#5494](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5494).

## Allow Lexicographic Filtering of Strings

Adds the ability to filter strings lexicographically by enabling comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, TO) on string values.
This new feature is useful when you want to filter on human-readable dates.

The following example shows how to filter movies released after 2024:
```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "filter": "release_date >= '2024'"
  }'
```

The following example shows how to filter movies released between June 2024 and June 2025:
```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "filter": "release_date 2024-06 TO 2025-06"
  }'
```
