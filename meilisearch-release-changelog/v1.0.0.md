# v1.0.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

We are proud to announce we are releasing the first major release of Meilisearch! üéâ This new release, contrary to v0.30.0, focus on stabilization instead of bringing new features. We took the opportunity to make the final touch regarding breaking changes in the CLI and the error handler.
To ensure the stability of Meilisearch, we will not introduce any breaking changes in future versions until the release of v2.0.0. Please refer to the following [information](https://github.com/meilisearch/engine-team/blob/main/resources/versioning-policy.md) for a definition of what we consider to be a breaking change in Meilisearch.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ Most integrations (SDKs, clients, libraries) will be compatible with this version within four hours of the release. Sometimes this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the issues we encounter during the release.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
Here is the exhaustive list of integrations  **not immediately compatible** with v1.0.0:
- TBD

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
üìñ Meilisearch's official documentation will be ready for the official v1.0.0 release. Meanwhile, work-in-progress documentation is available [here]().

# New features and improvements üî•

# Charabia

TBD

# Generate master key option

You can now activate the `--generate-master-key` CLI option when launching Meilisearch.

This option is particular since it won't launch Meilisearch but will generate a safe-to-use master key for Meilisearch and will exit without any error.

Done in #3274 by @dureuill

## Other improvements

* Re-enable importing from dumps v1: you can now migrate from Meilisearch v0.20.0 and older to the latest version using a dump (#3170) @dureuill
* Improve [`download-latest.sh`](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/main/download-latest.sh) script: integrate apple-silicon binary (#3169) @curquiza
* Clarify error message when the DB and engine versions are incompatible (#3279) @dureuill
* Search speed improvements:
  * synonyms (TBD)
  * ranking rules (TDB)
  * ... (TBD)

# Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

Since we are releasing v1.0.0, this is the last time we are introducing breaking changes to this release before v2.0.0.

## New CLI behavior

* For security reasons, Meilisearch will now reject master keys that are less than 16 bytes (#3274) @dureuill
* Remove `--max-index-size` and `--max-task-db` configuration options (#3278) @dureuill
Indeed, these options did not include the real space Meilisearch takes on the disk and were not adapted to the user's needs.
* Remove `--disable-auto-batching` CLI option (#3296) @loiclec
This option was initially introduced as a workaround in case of a bug and is no longer useful since the feature has matured.
* Rename dump command from `--dumps-dir` to `--dump-dir` (#3175) @dureuill
* Remove `--snapshot-interval-sec` and `--schedule-snapshot` now accepts an optional integer value specifying the interval in seconds (#3281) @dureuill
* The `--log-level` option and `MEILI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable now only accept the following arguments: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE` and `OFF` (#3293) @loiclec

## Revamped primary key inference

We have improved the primary key inference process when receiving documents for the first time.

If an index's primary key has not been specified earlier, Meilisearch will attempt to infer the primary key by searching for any properties ending with `id`, such as `puid` or` _id`. 

If only one such key is detected, it will be designated as the index primary key.

If multiple properties ending with `id` are detected, Meilisearch will notify you and ask you to specify the property representing the identifier of your documents instead of choosing the first found one.

If no primary key candidates are detected, Meilisearch will continue to throw an error as before.

Done in meilisearch/milli#752 and #3269 by @dureuill

## Error handler changes

* Add a new error `code`: `io_error` (used instead of `internal`) (#3263) @irevoire
* Add a new error `code`: `too_many_open_files` (used instead of `internal`) (#3263) @irevoire
* TBD (changes brought by Tamo)
