# v1.4.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.4 improves the search result relevancy by introducing three new settings: `nonSeparatorTokens`, `separatorTokens` and `dictionary`.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features‚Äîconsult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and improvements üî•

## Customize text separators

Meilisearch word segmentation uses a list of characters to separate one word from another. The `nonSeparatorTokens` and `separatorTokens` index settings allow you to configure this to better fit your dataset.

Add a character to the `separator-tokens` list to use it as a word separator:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/separator-tokens' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '["&sect;", "&sep"]'
```

Add a character to the `non-separator-tokens` list when you don't want Meilisearch to use it to separate words:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/non-separator-tokens' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '["@", "#", "&"]'
```

## Load a user-defined dictionary

The Meilisearch word segmentation relies on separators and language-based dictionaries to segment words. This segmentation could be more accurate on technical or use-case-specific vocabulary (like "G/Box" to say "Gear Box") or proper nouns (like "J. R. R." when parsing "J. R. R. Tolkien"). The `dictionary` setting improves this accuracy by defining a list of words that would be segmented as described in the list.

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/dictionary' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '["J. R. R.", "J.R.R."]'
```

These feature synergies well with the `stopWords` or the `synonyms` settings allowing to segment words and correctly retrieve what you expect:

```json
{
    "dictionary": ["J. R. R.", "J.R.R."],
    "synonyms": {
            "J.R.R.": ["jrr", "J. R. R."],
            "J. R. R.": ["jrr", "J.R.R."],
            "jrr": ["J.R.R.", "J. R. R."],
    }
}
```
