# v1.13.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should ONLY be put PRE-release changelogs -->
> [!WARNING]
> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.13 introduces several significant improvements, including stabilizing the Vector Store feature for seamless hybrid search integration! üéâ This version also simplifies the Meilisearch upgrade process: you don't need a dump for migrating anymore!

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## Stabilize Vector Store feature

After its initial release in v1.3.0, we have now fully stabilized the Vector Store feature. The experimental feature no longer requires manual activation, and the `vectorStore` field is no longer displayed or accepted by the `/experimental-features` route. This makes it even simpler to utilize our hybrid search capability, which delivers significantly better search relevance by combining traditional full text search with AI-powered semantic search.

### Breaking Changes before Stabilization

* Accepted Ollama URLs can only end with `/api/embed` and `/api/embeddings`.
* Modified error codes:
  - `invalid_embedder` has been split into `invalid_search_embedder` and `invalid_similar_embedder`. These codes are returned when the `embedder` parameter of a search (resp. similar) request refers to a non-existing embedder configuration or is not a string.
  - `invalid_hybrid_query` has been renamed to `invalid_search_hybrid_query`. It is returned when the `hybrid` parameter is invalid: contains unknown keys or is not either `null` or an object.
