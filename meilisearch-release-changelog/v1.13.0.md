> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.13 stabilizes AI-powered search integration! üéâ This release also introduces two new experimental features: upgrading to new Meilisearch releases without generating a dump, and making federated requests across multiple Meilisearch instances.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## AI-powered search and vector store stabilization

With v1.13, AI-powered search is available to all users by default and no longer requires manual activation.

### Breaking Changes

* `vectorStore` is no longer an accepted value for the `/experimental-features` route
* Ollama URLs must end with either `/api/embed` or `/api/embeddings`
* Modified error codes:
  - `invalid_embedder` has been split into `invalid_search_embedder` and `invalid_similar_embedder`. These codes are returned when the `embedder` parameter of a request to `/search`, `/multi-search` or `/similar` specifies a non-existing embedder or is not a string
  - `invalid_hybrid_query` has been renamed to `invalid_search_hybrid_query`. It is returned when the `hybrid` parameter contains unknown keys or is not either `null` or an object

## Experimental feature: Dumpless upgrades

Use `--experimental-dumpless-upgrade` after updating the Meilisearch binary to migrate to a new release:

```sh
./meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

This is a faster and more efficient process that does not require you to generate a dump and pass it to Meilisearch when upgrading to a new release.

> [!WARNING]
> Meilisearch strongly recommends you generate a backup snapshot before migrating. This is an experimental feature and failed upgrades may lead to database corruption.

Read more about it [on the dedicated product discussion](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/804).

## Experimental feature: Remote federated search requests

Use remote federated search requests together with the `/multi-search` route to query multiple Meilisearch instances at the same time. This is particularly useful when handling very large databases.

First, use the `/experimental-features` route to enable `network`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "network": true
  }'
```

Next, set up your network of Meilisearch instances with a call to `PATCH /network` configuring one `self` and multiple `remotes`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/network/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "remotes": {
      "ms-0": {
        "url": "http://ms-1235.example.meilisearch.io",
        "searchApiKey": "Ecd1SDDi4pqdJD6qYLxD3y7VZAEb4d9j6LJgt4d6xas"
      },
      "ms-1": {
        "url": "http://ms-4242.example.meilisearch.io",
        "searchApiKey": "hrVu-OMcjPGElK7692K7bwriBoGyHXTMvB5NmZkMKqQ"
      }
    },
    "self": "ms-0"
  }'
```
Repeat this process with every instance in your network, then add documents to them. Do not send the same documents to different instances.
Finally, make a `/multi-search` query with the new `federationOptions.remote`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/multi-search/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "federation": {},
    "queries": [
        {
            "q": "Batman returns dark",
            "indexUid": "movies",
            "federationOptions": {
                "remote": "ms-0"
            }
        },
        {
            "q": "Batman returns dark",
            "indexUid": "movies",
            "federationOptions": {
                "remote": "ms-1"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
