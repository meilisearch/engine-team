# v1.1.0 release changelogs

<!-- The following line should NOT be put in the official release changelogs -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.1.0 introduces the much-requested multi-index search! You can now use one single HTTP request to perform different searches in multiple indexes.

Additional new features include: `geoBoundingBox` geosearch filter, addition of a `facetStats` objects to queries using the `facets` search parameters, and customization of CSV separators.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
üß∞ Most integrations (SDKs, clients, libraries) will be compatible with this version within four hours of the release. Sometimes this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the issues we encounter during the release.

<!-- The following lines should ONLY be put in the official release changelogs -->
Here is the exhaustive list of integrations **not immediately compatible** with v1.1.0:

üìñ Meilisearch's official documentation will be ready for the official v1.1.0 release. Meanwhile, work-in-progress documentation is available [here]().

# New features and improvements üî•

## Multi-index search: allow multiple searches in a single request

Perform searches in multiple indexes in a single HTTP request using the new `/multi-search` endpoint:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/multi-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  --data-binary '{
    "queries": [
       {
         "indexUid": "products",
         "q": "Nike",
         "limit": 1
       },
      {
         "indexUid": "brands",
         "q": "Nike",
         "limit": 1
      }
    ]
  }'
```

When you use the multi-index search endpoint, Meilisearch returns an array of results for each queried index:

```json
{
	"results": [
	  {
	    "indexUid": "products",
	    "hits": [...],
	    "query": "Nike",
	    "processingTimeMs": 1,
	    "limit": 1,
	    "offset": 0,
	    "estimatedTotalHits": 17
	  },
	  {
	    "indexUid": "brands",
	    "hits": [...],
	    "query": "Nike",
	    "processingTimeMs": 0,
	    "limit": 1,
	    "offset": 0,
	    "estimatedTotalHits": 7
	  }
	]
}
```

## Introduce facet stats

When using the `facets` parameter during a search, statistics about the distributed facets are displayed in a `facetStats` object. This object will contain the minimum (`min`) and the maximum (`max`) of each numerical facet corersponding to search query.

Nothing needs to be activated, this information are available by default when requiring facets during a search (with the `facets` parameter).

Done by @dureuill in #3423.

## Geo-search improvements: introcdution of `geoBoundingBox`

When doing a filter (with the `filter` parameter) during the search, you can now use the `geoBoundingBox`: `_geoBoundingBox([lat, lng], [lat, lng])`, where the first argument is the top left corner, and the second one the bottom right corner.

Done by @gmourier and @irevoire in #3405 and #3529.

## Lifting the limits on index size and count

Before v1.0, the maximum size of an index on disk was limited according to the `--max-index-size` CLI parameter, and the number of indexes that could be accessed by one Meilisearch process would depend on this value (typically, about 1000 indexes with the default setting of 100GiB for `--max-index-size`).

v1.0 removed `--max-index-size` and fixed the maximum size of indexes to 500GiB, with about 200 concurrent indexes accessible to a Meilisearch process.

The removal of `--max-index-size` was made in preparation for this release: you can now use an unlimited number of indexes, whose maximum size will be only dictated by the memory address space devoted to a single process by the OS. The limit is at about 80TiB under Linux, you might run out of disk space before reaching it!

Done by @dureuill in #3319, #3331 and #3544.

## Experimental feature: monitore the Meilisearch usage by using Prometheus

This release introduces an experimental feature to follow your metrics by using Prometheus.

When launching Meilisearch, use the following flag:

```bash
meilisearch --experimental-enable-metrics
```

The `/metrics` route will be available and compatible with Prometheus.

üó£Ô∏è Since this feature is experimental, we need you to iterate on it! You are more than welcome to share your thoughts and your feedback on [this discussion](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/discussions/3518).

‚ö†Ô∏è The experimental feature API can break between 2 versions of Meilisearch. Be careful if using it in production.

Done by @irevoire, @dureuill, and @james-2001 in #3496, #3524, #3538 and #3543.

## Improve language support

* Enhance Greek support by normalizing diacritics and final sigma
* Enhance Arabic support by ignoring Tatweel
* Enhance language detection: the language is now detected when indexing to prevent from wrong language detections during the search
