# Meilisearch release process

This guide is to describe how to make releases and pre-releases for the [Meilisearch repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch).

At the beginning of the pre-release phase, the first RC is released. Other RCs will be done if bugs are found.

At the end of the pre-release phase, the official release is published.

> üìö More information about the sprint organization and the different sprint phases in this [guide](./sprint-organization.md).

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meilisearch pre-release phase

### How to create the first pre-release (or RC i.e. Release Candidate)

In the Meilisearch repository:

1. Ensure:
- the version of Meilisearch in the `Cargo.toml` files has been updated. Use [our automation](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/actions/workflows/update-cargo-toml-version.yml) if not -> click on `Run workflow`, and fill the appropriate version before validating. A PR updating all the versions in the `Cargo.toml` files will be created.
- A [GitHub Milestone](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/milestones) has been opened for this new version.

2. Make sure you are on the `main` branch and pull the last commits:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

3. Create a release branch named `release-vX.Y.Z` where `X.X.X` is the new version and push this branch

```bash
git checkout -b release-vX.Y.Z
git push -u origin release-vX.Y.Z
```

4. Go the the GitHub interface, in the [`Release` section](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases).

5. Click on the `Draft a new release` button

6. Fill the form with:
- the title of the release: `vX.Y.Z-rc.0`
- the tag associated to the release: should be `vX.Y.Z-rc.0`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è the branch on which to push the tag: `release-vX.Y.Z`. Do not push the tag to `main`!
- the description: add as many details as possible: the PRs, the authors, the new usage, the external contributors we want to thank...
- ‚ö†Ô∏è the `This is a pre-release` check box

7. Finally, when you are sure, click on the `Publish release` button.

‚öôÔ∏è The CIs will be triggered to:
- upload binaries to the associated GitHub pre-release.
- publish the associated Docker image (`vX.Y.Z`) to DockerHub.

### What if some bugs are in the RC?

1. Create a new branch starting from the branch `release-vX.Y.Z` and commit on this new branch.

2. Open and merge the PR originating this new branch and pointing to `release-vX.Y.Z`

### How to release the next RCs

When all/enough hotfixes have been done to the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch, create a new RC.
The steps are the same as for `How to create the first pre-release (or RC i.e. Release Candidate)` but starting from the step 4 and with the new RC name.

## üî• Meilisearch official release

### How to do the official release

1. Go the the GitHub interface, in the [`Release` section](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases).

2. Click on the `Draft a new release` button

3. Fill the form with:
- The title of the release: `vX.Y.Z`
- The tag associated to the release: should be `vX.Y.Z`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The branch on which to push the release: `release-vX.Y.Z`. Do not push the tag to `main`!
- The description. Add as many details as possible: the PRs, the authors, new usage examples, the external contributors we want to thank...
- Check the `Set as the latest release`
- Check the `Create a discussion for these release` if necessary (not for patch releases)

![GH release form](../assets/gh-release.png)

5. Finally, when you are sure, click on the `Publish release` button.
6. If you have chosen to create a discussion, go to the newly created one and
  - Add a small introduction section at the top of the description. Refer to [this one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/discussions/3459) as an example
  - Pin the discussion (and unpin the old one about the previous release)

‚öôÔ∏è The CIs will be triggered to:
- upload binaries to the associated GitHub release.
- publish the Docker images (`latest`, `vX.Y` and `vX.Y.Z`) to DockerHub.
- publish binaries for Homebrew and APT
- move the `latest` git tag to the release commit.

### After the release

Some commits might miss to `main` since the engine-team did some hotfixes merged to the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch.

In this case, you need to bring them back from `release-vX.Y.Z` to `main` by creating and merging a PR originating `release-vX.Y.Z` and pointing to `main`.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter any git conflicts when creating the PR, please do NOT fix the git conflicts directly on the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch. It would bring the changes present in `main` into `release-vX.Y.Z`, which would break a potential future patched release.

![GitHub interface showing merge conflicts](../assets/merge-conflicts.png)

Instead:
- Create a new branch originating `release-vX.Y.Z`, like `tmp-release-vX.Y.Z`
- Create a PR from the `tmp-release-vX.Y.Z` branch and pointing to `main`
- Fix the git conflicts on this new branch
    - By either creating a Pull Request and merging throught the GitHub interface
    - By pulling the `main` branch into `temp-release-vX.Y.Z`
- Merge this new branch into `main`

### How to do patched release (following hotfixes)

It happens some releases come with impactful bugs in production (e.g. indexation or search issues): we obviously don't wait for the next cycle to fix them and we release a patched version of Meilisearch.

1. Create a new release branch starting from the latest stable Meilisearch release (`latest` or `release-vX.Y.Z`).

```bash
# Ensure you get all the current tags of the repository
git fetch origin --tags --force

# Create the branch
git checkout latest
git checkout -b release-vX.Y.Z
git push -u origin release-vX.Y.Z
```

2. Open a [new GitHub Milestone `vX.Y.Z`](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/milestones) related to this new version.

3. Change the [version in `Cargo.toml` file](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/blob/e9b62aacb38f2c7a777adfda55293d407e0d6254/Cargo.toml#L21). You can use [our automation](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/actions/workflows/update-cargo-toml-version.yml) -> click on `Run workflow`, and fill the appropriate version before validating. A PR updating the version in the `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files will be created.

4. Open and merge the PRs (fixing your bugs): they should point to `release-vX.Y.Z` branch.

5. Follow all the steps in the ["How to do the official release" section](#how-to-do-the-official-release) with the patched version name.

6. Same as the official release, if needed, bring the new commits back from `release-vX.Y.Z` to `main` by merging a PR originating `release-vX.Y.Z` and pointing to `main`.

‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>If doing a patch release that should NOT be the `latest` release</s>:

- Do NOT check `Set as the latest release` when creating the GitHub release. If you did, quickly interrupt all CIs and delete the GitHub release!
- Once the release is created, you don't have to care about Homebrew, APT and Docker CIs: they will not consider this new release as the latest; the CIs are already adapted for this situation.
- However, the [CI updating the `latest` git tag](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/actions/workflows/latest-git-tag.yml) is not working for this situation currently and will attach the `latest` git tag to the just-created release, which is something we don't want! If you don't succeed in stopping the CI on time, don't worry, you just have to re-run the [old CI](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/actions/workflows/latest-git-tag.yml) corresponding to the real latest release, and the `latest` git tag will be attached back to the right commit.
