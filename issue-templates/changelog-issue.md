This issue is the entry point regarding the release changelog we must prepare before the first RC of <<version>>.

The changelog will be available as a PR in the [core-team repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/core-team). Once the PR is ready, the link will be shared in this issue.

@meilisearch/docs-team has to review the PR, if possible, before the first RC of <<version>>.
